# ULTRASHORT: basics ffmpeg and SDL2

This is the shortest showing only basics, no error checking no freeing of objects whatsever....
All in one short function...
No info display, no audio, nothing...See other examples (below number 6) for more info.

This code is just to show you what I have come up with after searching and experimenting. I am no expert in this field, it just might help you along...

Clear from this: SDL is the simplest and fastest...
