# Experiments with SDL, OpenGL, RGB bitmaps

This is a messy thing to test different approaches and see the resulting fps achievable.
Could be interesting to check conversions with swscale, how to display the converted bitmaps,
etc. It was a study project. Don't feel like further cleaning up. The method of using OpenGL got 
me only a maximum of 60 fps, half of the SDL performance. Bitmap approaches with TPaintbox gave about a maximum
of 60 fps.
Clear from this: SDL is the simplest and fastest...
